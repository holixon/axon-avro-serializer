A schema is required to write data and to read data. In particular, this means that Apache Avro is using a so-called schema-first approach. First, a schema is created and distributed, then it is used to serialize the message and used again to deserialize the message back.</p> <p>In general, the presence of the schema is sufficient to read and write data, but for statically-typed languages like Java or Kotlin, it is common to generate static classes using Avro Code Generator.</p> <p>Avro is flexible in where to get this schema from, so we defined a Schema Registry API to de-couple the user from the implementation of the schema registry. This allowed us to define multiple interchangeable implementation of the registry adapters.</p> <p>The following figure demonstrates this approach:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"concepts/event-generation.html","title":"Event generation","text":"<p>In order to work with the Axon Framework, we need to have Java (or Kotlin) classes representing the events defined in the schema to be available.

In general, we speak about event evolution, which is described in the context of Avro with the concept of Schema Evolution. Luckily, Avro provides a foundation of detection of schema changes and allows for a classification of those changes - some of those changes are non-breaking and some are breaking. The task for the upcaster is to overcome the breaking changes.</p> <p>In order to upcast a Avro-serialized message, the intermediate representation is constructed. Since it is not easily possible to upcast binary data directly, we provide a converter of binary data into a Generic Record format which is essentially a <code>Map&lt;String, Object&gt;</code> structure. An upcaster may modify this map to match the target event type. In addition, it needs to change the schema information (schema namespace, name, revision) of the <code>Generic Record</code> to match the reader schema.</p>"},{"location":"reference/index.html","title":"Implementation details","text":""},{"location":"reference/index.html#encoding","title":"Encoding","text":"<p>Apache Avro provides several encoding formats.
